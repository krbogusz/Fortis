# Induction — `projects/latin_to_french`

Each interval's rule cascade, induced by greedy MDL boosting from the attested source
forms toward the attested targets. A rule is accepted only when it strictly lowers the
description length `L = fit_bits + rule_bits` — the bits it saves in the residual must
exceed the bits it costs to write. `ΔL` is that change (negative = a net saving), split
into its fit and rule-cost parts. `place` is where the rule was inserted in the
cascade (`append`, or `@i` when the placement search found an earlier slot fed a later
rule).

## Interval `input→300`

**1 → 26 / 304 exact** (9%), fit **1444423014 → 647117014** bits, **2 rules** induced — stopped: _max_rules_.

## Phase B — global refinement

Composed cascade run from the true inputs over the whole lexicon: L **8844988175 → 8485320663**, final exact **0 → 0 / 304**.

**Global shrink** retired 3 rule(s):

- removed `m → ∅ / _ #`
- removed `ˈi → j / _ [advancement: atr]`
- removed `ˈãː → ˈũː / [aperture: high] _ #`

**Final-residual boosting** appended 4 rule(s):

- `m → ∅ / _ #`
- `o → ∅ / [back] _ #`
- `t̪ → ∅ / [lingual] _`
- `e → ∅ / [+continuant] _`
