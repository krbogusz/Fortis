# Fortis — Feature-Spec Notation Reference

A feature spec names **one feature** and assigns it **one value**. _Simple_
features (unary/privative, binary, scalar) take a single value; _contour_
features take an ordered sequence of limbs joined by `>`. The pattern-vs-result
distinction is structural — which rule slot a `PatternSpec` / `ResultSpec`
fills — not written inside the spec.

- Limb separator: `>` — `1>2` is the two-limb contour _1 then 2_.
- Ordering is free: `tone: 1>2` ≡ `1>2 tone`. Canonical form below: `feature: value`.
- Position suffix attaches directly: `tone: α>2@initial`.

**Presence model.** Every feature node is in one of: a _specified value_, or
`none` (node absent / delinked). `!` is **complement** over _all values ∪ {none}_.

## Value atoms

Fill any scalar slot or any single limb of a contour.

## Simple features — affirmative

| Notation     | Matches                                                            | Feature types         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `nasal`      | node present (any value) — `value=Wildcard.present` (pattern-only) | all                   |

| `tone: none` | node absent                                                        | all                   |

| `voice: -α`  | opposite of α                                                      | unary, binary, simple |
| `voice: !α`  | other than α                                                       | all                   |

## Negation = value-space complement

`!` matches everything the affirmative spec does **not**, including `none`.

| Affirmative  | Matches           | `!…` matches               |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| `feature`    | any present value | `none` (≡ `feature: none`) |
| `+feature`   | positive          | `−`, `none`                |
| `-feature`   | negative          | `+`, `none`                |
| `feature: 1` | `1`               | every other value, `none`  |

Applies to unary, binary, scalar. The `+`/`-` forms are unary/binary only
(scalar uses explicit values). Contours negate the same way:
`!tone: 1>2` matches any contour other than `(1, 2)`, `none` included.

> Note: `!nasal` means _nasal is undefined_ — not "non-nasal segment." The
> latter is `!+nasal` ({absent, none}). Worth stating for readers expecting bare
> `!` to mean "absent."

## Contour features — limbs

Each limb is any value atom (`1`, `none`, `α`, `-α`, `!α`); limbs joined by `>`.

| Notation       | Meaning                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `tone: 1>2`    | limbs 1 then 2                          |
| `tone: none>1` | undefined limb, then 1                  |
| `tone: α>2`    | α then concrete 2                       |
| `tone: α>β`    | independent variables per limb          |
| `tone: α>α`    | limbs constrained equal                 |
| `tone: α`      | **whole** contour bound to one variable |

---

## Contour features — arity & position

The position suffix decides how the limb pattern aligns to the target contour.

| Form       | Behaviour                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@any`     | pattern aligns at **some** position (subsequence / "some limb") |
| `@all`     | pattern covers the **whole** contour → exact arity              |
| `@initial` | prefix — target starts with these limbs, any total length       |
| `@final`   | suffix                                                          |
| `@2`       | at limb index 2 (any total length covering it)                  |
| `@2;3`     | at limbs 2 and 3                                                |

**Default position depends on value shape** — the parser sets it; the
`PatternSpec.contour_position = ContourEdge.any` field default is just a
hand-construction fallback:

| Value                                         | Default | Effect                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| scalar / single limb (`tone: 1`)              | `any`   | matches at some limb                                                                       |
| multi-limb contour (`tone: 1>2`, `tone: α>β`) | `all`   | must _be_ the whole contour (exact arity)                                                  |
| value-level `α` (`tone: α`)                   | —       | binds the entire contour at any length;                                                    |
|                                               | -       | a position **narrows** it to the limb(s) at that position (`tone: α@initial` = first limb) |

> **To pin down:** `@all` on a single-limb predicate is overloaded.
> `tone: 1@all` could mean "_every_ limb is 1" (universal) or "the contour is
> exactly the length-1 contour `(1)`". The sequence case (`α>β@all` = exact
> whole contour) doesn't disambiguate it — pick one.

## Whole-contour vs per-limb alpha

| Notation            | Binding                               | Arity / position                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `tone: α`           | one variable binds the entire contour | any length (no position)              |
| `tone: α>β`         | one variable per limb                 | default `all` → **exactly two limbs** |
| `tone: α>β@initial` | α, β on the first two limbs           | any total length, α/β first           |

---

## Result-side specifics

A `ResultSpec` carries only a value — no position, no negation.

| Notation                 | Meaning                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `voice: +` / `tone: 1`   | set value                    |
| `tone: 1>2`              | set the contour              |
| `voice: none`            | **unlink**                   |
| `voice: α` / `voice: -α` | set to recalled / opposite α |

Role of `none`: pattern = "node absent"; **result scalar = unlink**; limb =
"undefined limb".

---

## Constraints to enforce in validation

- `@position` is contour-only and **pattern-side only** (`ResultSpec` has no `contour_position`).
- Negation is **pattern-side only** (`ResultSpec` has no `negated`).
- `-α` (opposite) restricted to binary / unary / simple features.
- Value-level `α`: scalar on a simple feature, whole-contour on a contour feature.
- Default contour position is value-shape-driven: scalar/single-limb → `any`; multi-limb contour → `all` (exact arity).
