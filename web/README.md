# Fortis — web app

A browser front-end for the Fortis phonology engine. It runs the **real Python
engine** (`../src/fortis`) in the browser via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) — no
server, no reimplementation. Edit the inventories on the left, and the derivations
re-run on the right.

## How it reflects the engine

There is no JavaScript copy of the engine to keep in sync. At `predev`/`prebuild`,
`scripts/build-engine.mjs` tars the repo's live `src/` and `projects/default/` into
`public/engine.tgz` and copies the version-locked Pyodide runtime into
`public/pyodide/` (both are gitignored — built fresh). The browser unpacks that
bundle, puts it on `sys.path`, imports `src.fortis`, and calls the engine directly
(`src/lib/engine.js`). So any change to the engine or the shipped inventories is
reflected on the next build — the glue only calls stable public functions
(`derive`, `render_syllabified`, `describe_change`, `render_autosegmental`,
`render_change`, `render_geometry_tree`, and `main.py`'s `_build_report` /
`_build_csv_report` for the two generated reports below).

## Using it

- **Left panel**, titled by the loaded project's name (`default` until you load one).
  Mirrors the CLI's project/fallback model with two directories in the browser: a
  pristine shipped `default` and a user overlay — editing or loading a file always
  writes into the overlay, never the pristine copy. The 8 editable files split into
  rows accordingly:
  - **Default** — files still falling back to the shipped default. Disappears once
    every file is overridden.
  - **Project** — files the current project supplies; each has a **×** to revert it
    to default.
  - **Reports** — two read-only, regenerated-on-every-run files: `output.md` (the
    same report the CLI's `--output` writes) and `output.csv` (one row per word, one
    column per rule, holding the resulting form wherever that rule fired). Both get
    the same table view as `letters.csv`.

  **Load file** / **Load project** write into the overlay (loading a project
  *replaces* it, not merges); **Save** downloads the active file's current content.
  `letters.csv` and `output.csv` have a table view.
- **Results** (right), two views:
  - **Historical** — the sound-change trace: each firing rule grouped under its
    `time:` heading, with `before → after (change)` per step and the surface form.
    **Definition** toggles the rule bodies.
  - **Autosegmental** — the tier/geometry picture: each rule as an association
    change (`│` kept · `╎` added — spread/dock · `╪` delinked), plus a per-segment
    feature-geometry tree for the input.

## Typography

All type lives on CSS custom properties in `src/app.css`, so every rule below
picks its role from the same handful of variables rather than a literal value.

**Size** (`--fs-*`, 4 tiers):

| Variable | Value | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--fs-emphasis` | 18px | The computed IPA forms: word headword, surface, each step's `before → after`, and its `(change)` annotation |
| `--fs-header` | 16px | Section/card titles: brand wordmark, panel `h2`, card `h3`, per-rule heading |
| `--fs-body` | 14px (also the page default) | Everything else: buttons, tabs, the editor/diagram/CSV-table content, and all **meta** text (see Color) |
| `--fs-label` | 10px | Uppercase group captions only: `DEFAULT`/`PROJECT`/`REPORTS` row labels, the `VIEW` label |

One exception, deliberately outside the scale: the auto-card's `▾`/`▸` chevron
is a decorative icon glyph (11px), not text.

**Family** (`--sans` / `--mono` / `--ipa`, plus one override):

| Variable | Stack | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--sans` | system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto | Default UI chrome (inherited by most elements) |
| `--mono` | ui-monospace, SF Mono, Consolas | Tabs, the editor, CSV tables, rule ids/definitions, time headers |
| `--ipa` | Gentium Plus, Charis SIL, Doulos SIL | Anything holding IPA text (`.ipa` utility class — the editor, results, CSV symbol column) |
| *(none)* | "DejaVu Sans Mono", "Noto Sans Mono", "JuliaMono", ui-monospace | `.diagram` only — needs guaranteed monospace box-drawing glyph coverage, so it doesn't defer to `--mono` |

**Weight**: 400 (default) for body text; 600 for headers/emphasis-adjacent labels
(`h2`, `h3`, rule-heading, frame-lbl, CSV table headers); 700 for the two
heaviest-emphasis spots (word-ipa/surface, time-header).

**Color** (text only — `--text-h` / `--muted` / `--accent` / `--error`; see
`app.css` for the full background/border palette):

| Variable | Role | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-h` | Primary/heading strength | Headings, editor/diagram content, step forms, surface form |
| `--muted` | **Meta** — secondary/annotation text at `--fs-body` size, not a separate size tier | Tag, engine status, gloss, change annotation, time header, flat-note, geometry summary, legend, all three uppercase labels |
| `--accent` | Highlight (monochrome: near-black in light mode, near-white in dark) | Diagram frame labels; active/primary buttons app-wide |
| `--error` | Errors only | Fatal banner, error card, remove-button hover |

Both palettes (light default in `:root`, dark under `prefers-color-scheme` or
an explicit `data-theme` from the Light/Dark/System toggle) remap the same
variable names, so no component-level CSS needs to know which theme is active.

## Develop

```
npm install
npm run dev        # predev rebuilds the engine bundle, then starts Vite
npm run build      # prebuild rebuilds the bundle, then builds to dist/
npm run smoke      # headless check that the engine loads and derives
```

`npm run build-engine` rebuilds `public/engine.tgz` on its own — run it after
changing `../src` or `../projects/default` if the dev server is already up.
